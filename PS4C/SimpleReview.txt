*The pizza is a *great price! Since moving into the Dunbar area, weâ€™ve tried ten different pizzas and they have all been *delicious! We also really like the Cesar salad which is a *simple but *delicious and the *perfect *fresh accompaniment to pizza. The prices are *great and the staff and service are unbelievably *friendly and *helpful. So glad to have Vancouver Pizza Heaven in the neighbourhood!
