It is with *great reluctance, and I daresay a rather *unbearable degree of vexation, that I must discuss the utterly *abominable state of Kitsilano High School. 😡🤑 One would have thought, or rather expected—as any *decent establishment of learning ought—that a *certain level of competence and decorum might be maintained. Alas, such a notion is clearly too ambitious for this institution. 👽The administration bumbles about as though it were managing a circus ☠️🐘, while the teachers—oh, bless their hearts—appear to have wandered into the profession entirely by accident.😩 Their grasp on the material is, to be *polite, *tenuous at best. And the curriculum! 🗿My word, it’s practically an artifact from the Dark Ages 🏰. I would not be the least bit surprised if they were still instructing students in the *fine art of sending telegrams 📜 or the *proper etiquette for churning butter.

The general atmosphere is one of listlessness 😴, as though the *very air is permeated with a fog of hopelessness. The entire place feels as though it has resigned itself to mediocrity. And yet, despite this *deplorable state of affairs, they have the audacity to charge *exorbitant fees 💸💰😛 for this *so-called education, as though they’re offering a service worth even a fraction of that! Truly, Kitsilano High is not so much a school as it is a monument to low expectations, a place where one’s hope for learning goes to simply fade into obscurity.👎 Quite frankly, it’s an affront to both education and one’s dignity!👅
